# AWS Storage Extras

## AWS Snowball

- Highly secure, portable devices to **collect and process data at the edge**, and **migrate data into and out of AWS**
- Helps migrate up to Petabytes of data

### Data Migrations with Snowball

Challenges:

- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (can’t maximise the line)
- Connection stability

> **AWS Snowball: offline devices to perform data migrations**
> If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

### What is Edge Computing?

- Process data while it’s being created at an edge location
  - A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
- These locations may have limited internet and no access to computing power
- We set up a **Snowball Edge** device to do edge computing
  - Snowball Edge Compute Optimised (dedicated for that use case) & Storage Optimised
  - Run EC2 Instances or Lambda functions at the edge
- Use cases: preprocess data, machine learning, transcoding media

### Solution Architecture: Snowball into Glacier

- **Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly**
- You must use Amazon S3 first, in combination with an S3 lifecycle policy

  - Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
- Storage shrinks or grows automatically
- Snapshots, replication, low-cost, compression and data de-duplication
- **Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)**

### Amazon FSx for OpenZFS

- Up to 1,000,000 IOPS with < 0.5ms latency
- Snapshots, compression and low-cost
- **Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)**

## Hybrid Cloud for Storage

- AWS is pushing for ”hybrid cloud”
  - Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
  - Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
- This can be due to
  - Long cloud migrations
  - Security requirements
  - Compliance requirements
  - IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises?
- AWS Storage Gateway!

### AWS Storage Cloud Native Options

![[Pasted image 20260129210714.png]]

### AWS Storage Gateway

- Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data
- **Use cases:**
  - disaster recovery
  - backup & restore
  - tiered storage
  - on-premises cache & low-latency files access
- Types of Storage Gateway:
  - **S3 File Gateway**
  - **Volume Gateway**
  - **Tape Gateway**

### Amazon S3 File Gateway

- Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocols
- **Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway**
- Supports S3 Standard, S3 Standard IA, S3 One Zone A, S3 Intelligent Tiering
- **Transition to S3 Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy**
- Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
- SMB Protocol has integration with Active Directory (AD) for user authentication

### Volume Gateway

- Block storage using the iSCSI protocol backed by S3
- Backed by EBS snapshots, which can help restore on-premises volumes!
- **Cached volumes**: low latency access to the most recent data
- **Stored volumes**: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3

### Tape Gateway

- Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes (!)
- With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud
- Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
- Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
- Works with leading backup software vendors

### AWS Storage Gateway

  - **AWS Transfer for FTPS** (File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS))
  - **AWS Transfer for SFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP))
- Managed infrastructure, Scalable, Reliable, Highly Available (multi-AZ)
- Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
- Store and manage users’ credentials within the service
- Integrate with existing authentication systems (Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP, Okta, Amazon Cognito, custom)
- Usage: sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP, …

### AWS DataSync

- Move a large amount of data to and from
  - On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API…) – needs agent
  - AWS to AWS (different storage services) – no agent needed
- Can synchronise to:
  - Amazon S3 (any storage classes – including Glacier)
  - Amazon EFS
  - Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre, NetApp, OpenZFS...)
- Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, or weekly
- **File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB…)**
- One agent task can use 10 Gbps, and can set up a bandwidth limit

#### AWS DataSync - NFS / SMB to AWS (S3, EFS, FSx…)
